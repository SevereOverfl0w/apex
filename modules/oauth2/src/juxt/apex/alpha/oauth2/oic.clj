  "opts is always a map containing the following:

  :openid-config - a map (read from JSON, with string keys preserved)
  of the OpenID Provider Metadata, see
  https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig

  :client-id - a string representing the id of the OAuth2 client

  :client-secret - a string representing the OAuth2 client secret

  :redirect-uri - a string representing an absolute URI of the OAuth2 redirect URI

  :jwks - a map containing the JWKS key set (read from JSON, with string keys preserved)

  :scope - scope query parameter sent to the authorization_endpoint (optional, defaults to 'openid')

  IMPORTANT: All handlers in this namespace require ring-session to be
  present in the middleware chain.

= juxt.apex.alpha.oauth2.jwt

This is a small wrapper around an excellent Java library for JWT,
https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt[Nimbus].

The choice of Nimbus over Buddy https://github.com/funcool/buddy.

Nimbus uses algorithms 'native' to the JDK which are more mainstream
than bouncycastle, used by Buddy. Since Apex is extremely judicious in
adding dependencies, this is seen as a benefit. Also, Nimbus is
written with JWT verification in mind, as opposed to a lower-level
general crypto library.

Nimbus is apparently used in production and relatively well
battle-tested.

NOTE: Under the current legal regime in Australia (Assistance and Access
Bill 2018), crypto eminating from there cannot be considered
trustworthy.

This wrapper supports RSA and EC. OKP and `oct` are as yet
unsupported.
